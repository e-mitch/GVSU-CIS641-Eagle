I am creating an app that I believe will be called Commentarius (Latin for "diary") which is intended  
to allow people to create freeform diary entries and tag specific areas of text within entries with  
custom tags. The user can then access individual entries or access all text which has been given  
a certain tag. Users can create, read, update, and delete entries or tagged text. They can also filter  
entries or tagged text by year or month. The app is especially targeted toward people who have  
serious medical diagnoses, whose entries may contain things like questions for doctors,  
breakthroughs, side effects, etc. Each of these categories could be assigned a tag. The overall  
goal of the app is to allow people to write freely but easily access specific categories of text later.
